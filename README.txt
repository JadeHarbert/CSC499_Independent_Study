Reference Daily Intake program that utilizes OpenCV and PyTesseract. 

This application scans nutirition labels based off of pictures that are inputted into the program. It then creates dictionaries for every nutiriton value with name, value, and percentage.

Once the dictionary has been created, it then asks the user for how many servings that the user consumes and calculates how much of each nutrition the user now has consumed.

This application was created for an independent study that was centered around OpenCV
